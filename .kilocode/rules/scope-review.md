# Scope Review Rules

When a Scope Review is requested you MUST follow these rules:

- Check that all requirements mentioned in the task are handled.
- Check that all unit tests assert what their method name suggests.
- Check that no unit tests made to be trivial.
- Check that all changes in code are related to the given task.
- Check that all new code and unit tests are related to the given task.
- Check that no unrelated code or unit tests were deleted.
- Visually verify that all new and changed screenshot test recordings (read_file) and other images are in scope and match expectations.
- Fixing compilation, tests and satisfying static analysis tools even in unrelated areas is always considered in scope as it is required to be 'done'.
