# Architecture & Tech Review Rules

When an Architecture & Tech Review is requested you MUST follow these rules:

- Review code changes for violations of architecture and tech decisions specified in:
  - [.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md:1)
  - [.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md:1)
- First synthesize a comprehensive list of requirements to check in a todo list. Include every little coding rule.
- Then validate each single requirement.
- Focus on details and report every small violation.
