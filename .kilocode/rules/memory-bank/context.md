# SmartDocs AI - Current Context

## Current Work Focus
Simplified requirements.txt creation - eliminated LangChain dependencies and version conflicts to resolve Docker build failures.

## Recent Changes
- **Requirements.txt Simplified**: Removed all LangChain packages and created minimal dependency set
- **Direct API Integration**: Switched to direct OpenAI client and ChromaDB usage without LangChain wrappers
- **Version Conflict Resolution**: Eliminated complex dependency chains causing Docker build issues
- Memory bank system being established with core documentation files
- Project analysis completed across frontend and backend components
- Identified key architectural patterns and technology stack
- Introduced localStorage persistence for chat histories (Zustand persist)

## Project State

### Backend Status
- **FastAPI Application**: Fully implemented in [`main.py`](../../../backend/main.py:1)
- **Dependency Status**: Simplified to essential packages only - FastAPI, OpenAI client, ChromaDB, pypdf
- **Core Features**: PDF processing, vector embeddings, chat QA pipeline all implemented
- **API Endpoints**: `/health`, `/upload`, `/ask` with proper error handling
- **Vector Storage**: ChromaDB with persistent storage under `backend/vectorstores/`

### Frontend Status  
- **React/TypeScript SPA**: Complete modern interface with routing
- **Key Components**: Document upload, chat interface, markdown rendering
- **UI System**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system and dark theme
- **State Management**: React hooks for document and chat state
- **API Integration**: Axios-based client with proper error handling

### Development Environment
- **Backend**: Python 3.12+, FastAPI, requires OpenAI API key
- **Frontend**: Node.js 18+, Vite, React 19
- **Dependencies**: Clean minimal set with no version conflicts
- **Development Servers**: FastAPI dev server (port 8000), Vite dev server (frontend)

## Next Steps
1. Complete memory bank initialization
2. Update backend code to use direct APIs instead of LangChain wrappers
3. Validate end-to-end functionality with proper environment setup
4. Consider additional features or improvements based on testing

## Current Blockers
- Backend code needs refactoring to use direct OpenAI and ChromaDB APIs
- OpenAI API key configuration needed for full functionality
- Text processing utilities need updating for direct ChromaDB integration

## Development Notes
- Project follows modern full-stack patterns with clear separation of concerns
- Frontend uses advanced React patterns with TypeScript
- Backend implements lazy loading for AI dependencies
- Both components have comprehensive error handling and user feedback
