# SmartDocs AI - Current Context

## Current Work Focus
Memory bank initialization - establishing comprehensive project documentation for effective future collaboration and development.

## Recent Changes
- Memory bank system being established with core documentation files
- Project analysis completed across frontend and backend components
- Identified key architectural patterns and technology stack

## Project State

### Backend Status
- **FastAPI Application**: Fully implemented in [`main.py`](../../../backend/main.py:1)
- **Known Issues**: LangChain dependency configuration needs resolution (documented in [`fix_plan.md`](../../../backend/fix_plan.md:1))
- **Core Features**: PDF processing, vector embeddings, chat QA pipeline all implemented
- **API Endpoints**: `/health`, `/upload`, `/ask` with proper error handling
- **Vector Storage**: ChromaDB with persistent storage under `backend/vectorstores/`

### Frontend Status  
- **React/TypeScript SPA**: Complete modern interface with routing
- **Key Components**: Document upload, chat interface, markdown rendering
- **UI System**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system and dark theme
- **State Management**: React hooks for document and chat state
- **API Integration**: Axios-based client with proper error handling

### Development Environment
- **Backend**: Python 3.12+, FastAPI, requires OpenAI API key
- **Frontend**: Node.js 18+, Vite, React 19
- **Dependencies**: Some backend LangChain packages need installation
- **Development Servers**: FastAPI dev server (port 8000), Vite dev server (frontend)

## Next Steps
1. Complete memory bank initialization
2. Address backend dependency issues identified in fix plan
3. Validate end-to-end functionality with proper environment setup
4. Consider additional features or improvements based on testing

## Current Blockers
- Backend requires `langchain-openai` and `langchain-chroma` package installation
- OpenAI API key configuration needed for full functionality
- Some import paths in backend need minor corrections

## Development Notes
- Project follows modern full-stack patterns with clear separation of concerns
- Frontend uses advanced React patterns with TypeScript
- Backend implements lazy loading for AI dependencies
- Both components have comprehensive error handling and user feedback
