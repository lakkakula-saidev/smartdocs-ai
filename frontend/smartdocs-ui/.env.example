# SmartDocs AI Frontend - Environment Variables Template
# Copy to .env.local for local development

# === API Configuration ===
# Local backend (dev)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
# Example production (Railway) - override in Vercel dashboard
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-name.up.railway.app

# === Branding ===
VITE_APP_NAME=SmartDocs AI

# === Build / Debug Flags ===
# Set to true to enable additional console debug output (optional future use)
VITE_DEBUG=false
# Emit source maps during build (leave false in real production to avoid exposing code)
# BUILD_SOURCEMAP=true

# Notes:
# 1. All variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be exposed to the client.
# 2. Do NOT commit any secrets here (no API keys belong in the frontend).
# 3. In Vercel, define VITE_API_URL and VITE_APP_NAME via project settings.
# 4. BUILD_SOURCEMAP is read only at build time; enable temporarily when debugging deployed bundle.
