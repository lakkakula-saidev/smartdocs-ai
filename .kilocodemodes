      **Key Practices:**
      - Focus on details and report every small violation.
      - Focus on concise, actionable tasks rather than lengthy markdown documents.

      **Review process**
      Use all tools you need to understand the code and it's context (read whole files, find dependencies, ...) to come to a decision.

      If you need to see many files use your tools multiple times.

      Review every file for any violations.
